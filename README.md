Day 5:
Today's Progress:
Today, I worked on several loops and conditional problems using Python, including a for loop, summing scores, finding maximum and second maximum values, and building patterns using loops. I also created a FizzBuzz implementation, experimented with random number generation, and built a password generator from random characters.

What I Learned:

For Loops: Reiterated the use of for loops to iterate over lists and generate patterns, such as a right-angled triangle and equilateral triangle.
Summing and Max Values: Learned how to sum a list of numbers manually and used loops to find both the maximum and second maximum scores in a list.
Pattern Generation: Created patterns such as triangles and rhombuses using nested loops and printed them to the console.
FizzBuzz: Revisited the FizzBuzz problem to practice conditionals within loops.
Dice Generator: Implemented a dice generator where the user inputs a dice code and it rolls random numbers based on the input.
Password Generator: Created a random password generator that allows the user to specify the number of letters, symbols, and numbers, shuffles them, and outputs a random password.
Challenges:
Managing loops for pattern generation (especially for the rhombus) was challenging, as was finding the second maximum value efficiently without using Python's built-in max() for that step.

Thoughts:
The password generator was a fun exercise. It gave me more confidence in working with random numbers and manipulating lists. I plan to extend this with more features, such as making passwords more secure by checking for requirements like minimum length and character diversity.
